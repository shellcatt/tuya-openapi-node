### Useful Hints
- Device `online` heartbeat timeout is ~5 minutes, so even though online status is registered within ~30 seconds, official `offline` status is registered within the heartbeat timeout 
- status function values (`switch_*`, `colour_data_*`, etc.) have their values updated instantaniously, so they can be used to determine a device's responsiveness
- Most light bulbs (`dj`) consume ~30 Watts in `white` mode, and <~30 Watts in `colour` mode
- Power sockets (`cz`) report down to at least ~32 Watts as measurable power consumption
